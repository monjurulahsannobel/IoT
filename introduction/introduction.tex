\chapter{Problem Statement}
We are living in a modern world where we get benefited from different applications of science. But we often find some difficulties around us such as- we don't know the oxygen we are inhaling is fresh or not, we can't find any existence of gas in the air, we don't know the temperature and humidity unless we measure it and even we don't get any warning of higher sounds so that we can protect ourselves from being deaves.

Here, I tried to solved these problem by implementing an IoT based system. I will be using some sensors to measure the parameters of temperature, gas, $CO$, Humidity and sound. Then I will send the warning or amount of their existence to people's device. By this way, people will get notified about the temperature, gas, $CO$, humidity and sound in their surrounding.

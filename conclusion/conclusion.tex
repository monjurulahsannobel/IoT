\chapter{Solution and Outcome}
LM35, MQ6, MQ9, HDT11 and KY038 will be connected to the arduino board in A0, A1, A2, A3, A4 pin. The SIM900 will be connected to the tx-rx of arduino board. And there will be power supply of 5 volt. Then all the sensors will read the values and send them to the arduino board. It will process them as per the given instruction and then send the prepared result to me using the SIM900. I will be able to know all the information from my mobile.\newline
By this way, I will be able to know-
\begin{enumerate}[1.]
    \item the temperature of my surroundings.
    \item the humidity of my room and outsides.
    \item if there is access sound outside there and I will be able to protect my ears.
    \item if there is any gas leakage.
    \item the amount of Carbon Monoxide of the air.
\end{enumerate}
